# H2O-Safe-Water-Quality-Analysis
This project involves analyzing water quality data to determine whether water samples are safe for consumption. The analysis includes data cleaning, exploration, and visualization to uncover patterns and insights from the dataset.
Key Steps in the Analysis:
Data Loading: The dataset is loaded using Pandas.
Data Cleaning: Handling missing values and correcting data types.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Visualizing outliers using box plots.
Plotting a correlation matrix to understand relationships between variables.
Generating histograms to observe the distribution of variables.
Visualization: Various plots are created using Seaborn and Matplotlib to explore the data.
To run this project, you will need the following Python packages:
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
