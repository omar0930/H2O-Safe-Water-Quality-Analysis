# H2O-Safe: Water Quality Analysis

## Overview
H2O-Safe is a water quality analysis project aimed at detecting contaminants in water sources using machine learning techniques. The project leverages data science and visualization tools to provide insights into water safety levels and potential risks.

## Features
- **Water Quality Prediction**: Uses machine learning models to predict water contamination levels.
- **Data Visualization**: Interactive charts and graphs for better data understanding.
- **Multi-source Data Analysis**: Processes data from various water sources.
- **User-friendly Interface**: Easy-to-use interface for data exploration.

## Dataset
- The dataset consists of various water quality parameters collected from multiple sources.
- Features include pH, turbidity, dissolved oxygen, and contamination levels.
